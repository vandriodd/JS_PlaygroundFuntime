# TypeScript Google Maps Clone

This project is a Google Maps clone with a focus on practicing and demonstrating TypeScript skills. It aims to replicate basic functionalities of Google Maps, such as map visualization, place searching, and zoom controls, while leveraging TypeScript's strong typing system to ensure more robust and error-resistant code.

## Learning objectives

- Understand and apply TypeScript types to enhance JavaScript code reliability.
- Implement TypeScript interfaces and classes to model Google Maps functionalities.
- Use TypeScript with external APIs (OpenStreetMap) for map rendering and manipulation.
- Practice TypeScript modules for better code organization.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript: Main programming language for the project.
- OpenStreetMap (OSM) API: Used for map functionalities. The choice depends on licensing and project requirements.
- React/tailwindcss: For creating and styling the user interface.

### Notes

- Avoid use single definition for objects, use interfaces instead.
- In some cases is preferable to use generics instead of `any`, specially when working with arrays.
